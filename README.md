# Question: How do you solve the paint house problem for minimizing painting costs over multiple houses? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `minCost` is designed to solve the paint house problem, which aims to minimize the cost of painting a series of houses such that no two adjacent houses are painted the same color. The function takes a 2D array as input, where each sub-array represents a house and each element within the sub-array represents the cost of painting that house a specific color. The function first checks if the input array is null or empty, and if so, returns 0. It then iterates over the array, starting from the second house, and for each house, it adds to the cost of painting it a specific color the minimum cost of painting the previous house any other color. This ensures that no two adjacent houses are painted the same color and that the cost is minimized. Finally, the function returns the minimum total cost of painting all the houses, which is the minimum of the costs of painting the last house any color. This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript version. Both versions use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost to paint each house with each color, and then return the minimum cost to paint the last house with any color.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. The TypeScript version uses a class to encapsulate the solution, while the JavaScript version uses a function. This makes the TypeScript version more object-oriented.

2. The TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of the variables and the return type of the function. This can help catch type-related errors at compile time, which is not possible in JavaScript.

3. The TypeScript version uses the spread operator (...) in the final return statement to get the minimum value from the array, while the JavaScript version uses the Math.min function with three arguments. This makes the TypeScript version more flexible and easier to read.

4. The TypeScript version does not check if the costs array is null, while the JavaScript version does. This is because in TypeScript, it is assumed that the input will be a valid 2D array due to the type annotation.

5. The TypeScript version uses the `let` keyword to declare variables, while the JavaScript version uses `var`. The `let` keyword provides block scope variable declaration, which is not available in JavaScript when using `var`.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using the same dynamic programming approach. They both iterate over the array of costs, updating each cost to be the current cost plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house a different color. They then return the minimum cost of painting the last house any color.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Syntax: C++ uses a different syntax for defining functions, declaring variables, and for loops. For example, C++ uses the `vector` data type to represent arrays, and the `min` function from the `algorithm` library to find the minimum of two values.

2. Null/Empty Check: In JavaScript, the check for an empty array is `costs == null || costs.length == 0`. In C++, this is done with `costs.empty() || costs[0].empty()`. The C++ version also checks if the first element of the array is empty, which the JavaScript version does not do.

3. Copying the Array: In JavaScript, the `costs` array is modified directly. In C++, a copy of the `costs` array is made and modified. This is done with `vector<vector<int>> dp = costs;`.

4. Getting the Last Element: In JavaScript, the last element of an array is accessed with `costs[costs.length - 1]`. In C++, this is done with `dp.back()`.

5. Output: In JavaScript, the result is output with `console.log()`. In C++, this is done with `cout <<`.

6. Main Function: In C++, the code is wrapped in a `main()` function, which is required for it to run. JavaScript does not require a main function.
